Description: Range of a species or habitat type is a crucial parameter in Article 17 reporing 
    under Habitats Directive. While distribution is a representation of the occurrences in the
    10x10 km grid, range calculation is more sophisticated. Range is obtained by generalizing 
    the distribution, by creating envelope(s) around the distribution grids using a parameter
    named 'gap distance'.
