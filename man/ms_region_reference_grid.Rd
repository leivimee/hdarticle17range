\usage{
ms_region_reference_grid(
  memberstate = "EE",
  biogeoregion = "BOR",
  countryborders = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{memberstate}{Two-letter code of a member state.}

\item{biogeoregion}{Three or four-letter code of biogeographical region.}

\item{countryborders}{Polygon geometry of member state.}
}
\value{
Returns grid cells of a member state in specific biogeographic region.
}
\description{
`ms_region_reference_grid` is a function that returns grid
cells of a specific biogeoregion of a member state.
}
\details{
By default this function returns intersecting cells of a member
state reference grid and biogeographical region. Member state area
can be specified in input to fine-tune the result or exclude
irrelevant cells.
}
\examples{
# library(sf)
# load country borders
data(eesti)
# get MS biogeoregion cells
bor_cells_ee <- ms_region_reference_grid("EE", "BOR", eesti)
# plot cells
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(bor_cells_ee)+geom_sf(fill=NA)+theme_void()
